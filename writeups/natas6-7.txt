This one is fairly easy. The page presents two links, the links are using a parameter
to link to a site. We modify what that link parameter is to get to the file where
the password is stored for the next level. This is an XSS attack. The link to get the
password is this:
http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8

Notice that the 'page' parameter is modified to access the natas8 pass file which
our user (natas7) has access to.
