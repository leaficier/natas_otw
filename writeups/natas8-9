This level deals with input validation, the source code shows us that there is a PHP
script that is using the passthru function to run a command on the host and returning
that output to the page. There is a command injection exploit here. We can change the
command output by commenting out what file is being grep'd and grep a different file
ie the password file. The input I used to do this is as follows:

  j /etc/natas_webpass/natas10 #

I searched for a random letter ('j') in the password file, and I added a # to comment
out the original file.
