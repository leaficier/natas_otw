This level is very basic directory traversal.
The steps I took were first looking at the source.
There is a an embedded image with the source address as:
  files/pixel.png
This is a hint that there may be more things in the 'files'.
Next step is to navigate to: natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files
A directory listing appears.
The password is in the users.txt file.
