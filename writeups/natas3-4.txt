This level is related to the Referer header field.
The site checks to see if the Referer is set to EXACTLY: http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
All I had to do was go into firefox Developer tools, into the network section, and edit the header.
After changing the Referer field, you can look in the 'Response' tab to see the answer.
