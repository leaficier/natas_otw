This one is another one of those secret input questions. This time, the secret
is still within the source, but it is encoded in various ways via PHP code. The
secret is base64 encoded, then reversed, then converted to hex. I wrote some PHP
code to reverse the operations and find what the secret is without all the encoding.
Since I don't know PHP very well, I just took the same commands and reversed the order,
except for the bin2hex function, of which I had to look for a different function (http://mindofscott.com/Opposite_PHP_bin2hex.htm).
This is my code:

<?php
$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function decodeSecret($input) {
	return base64_decode(strrev(pack('H*', $input)));
}

print decodeSecret($encodedSecret); <---- here is where the secret key gets printed

I just ran this code in an online PHP tester thing.

Take the output from the PHP code and plug it into the main site for the password.
